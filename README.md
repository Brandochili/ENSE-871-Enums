The Saskatchewan Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development (SK RCE or ESD) seeks to transform education for sustainability in our region. Education includes formal education (such as primary, secondary, and post-secondary education) as well as informal and non-formal education (such as the private media and public education by non-governmental organizations). 

Education respects the autonomy and dignity of the learner. Education for sustainable development helps us work together to identify and pursue paths to sustainability, leading to improvements in quality of life while sustaining healthy ecosystems. They promote active environmental stewardship, social justice, and intergenerational equity.
